Craps simulator in Python.

I've been enjoying playing virtual craps on mobile. But wanted to see what I could replicate.

Very basic for now.

# Commands
1. python main.py -c 10
2. python main.py --count 10

# Odds
| Numbers | Odds  |
| ------- | ----- |
| 6/8     | x2.00 |
| 5/9     | x2.25 |
| 4/10    | x3.00 |
